The code provided earlier works for PIC24FJ/dsPIC chips where dedicated timers (OCxTMR) do not exist.

On some PIC24FJ chips (PIC24FJxxGA10x for example), the output compare modules have their own dedicated timers, OC1TMR..OC5TMR, which can be other timers, or the system clock.

For those chips, the following code is provided to get you up to 5 additional "virtual clocks".

Note: there is no prescaler on those chips for the output compare modules. the calls below, tmroc_initn(), n=1..5, take a prescaler parameter for compatability reasons. That parameter is simply ignored by the call.
